(Machine Learning) Whatâ€™s the difference between logistic regression and support vector machines? What's an example of a situation where you would use one over the other?
(Machine Learning) Explain ICA and CCA. How do you get a CCA objective function from PCA?
(Machine Learning) What is the relationship between PCA with a polynomial kernel and a single layer autoencoder? What if it is a deep autoencoder?
(Machine Learning) What is "random" in random forest? If you use logistic regression instead of a decision tree in random forest, how will your results change?
(Modeling) What is the interpretation of an ROC area under the curve as an integral?
